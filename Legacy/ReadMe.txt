        About
=============================
This build, being a very old standard, was used to compile the following projects: Doom Builder 2, Doom Builder 64, and GZDoom Builder with zero modification and little customization.  Do not confuse this legacy build with the current official builds; ideals and practices between the two are far distant from each other.  For example, this old build is very limited as to what tasks it can perform efficiently, while the latest build offers further flexibility and customization.  In addition, I don't guarantee that this build even remotely works - by which I mean compiling the projects.  Only use this version if you need this build for a specific reason that is different than the modern build.  If you plan to use this version, do understand that you will be subjected to different ideas, environment, limitations, and bugs.  I strongly urge users to adapt to the modern build, but if you need this build specifically - please use this at your own risk.

    Compile Project
    Compile Project Plugins
    Generate help documentation
