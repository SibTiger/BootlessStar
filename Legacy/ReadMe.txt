    MakePrivateBuild
        About
=============================
This build, being a very old standard, was used to compile the following projects: Doom Builder 2, Doom Builder 64, and GZDoom Builder with zero modification and little customization.  Do not confuse this legacy build with the current official builds; ideals and practices between the two are far distant from each other.

This legacy supports the following tasks:
    Compile Project
    Compile Project Plugins
    Generate help documentation



Requirements
