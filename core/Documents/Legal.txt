=============================


I have removed the code and the terms of agreement wording from this section.  I am sure that it is not accurate and I am not a lawyer, but instead I am just a creator.  I have created this program for several reasons:
    A} To make some tedious tasks - less tedious and expeditious
    B} To help others get the job[s] finished
    C} Allow everyone to use this program and even further expand it for their reasons or purposes

In exchange all that I ask for those wanting to create a script or module [I can't force anyone to follow these]:
    A} When you create a module or script that is designed for this program, do NOT mislead the user.  Thus, do not cause intentional harm to the user our their system.
    B} Modules and scripts source code should always be available.  With batch, that shouldn't be much of a problem as the scripts are already readable.

If someone wishes to take this entire program and up[date|grade] it or change it for whatever reasons, feel free to-do so.  Do not, however, charge users (currency wise) for using and retrieving the program.  I [the creator of this program] would like _some_ credit for the main work, the meaning of _some_ can be a simple comment within the program.
