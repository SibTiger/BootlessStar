Project Modules OR External Scripts?

Project Modules:
    Project Modules are designed to run in Bootless Star's environment.
        This can not be executed _WITHOUT_ Bootless Star, thus - it is not possible to run the program immediately by double-clicking the shell script.


External Scripts
    Program scripts that can be executed without needing Bootless Star's controlled environment.
        This can be executed _WITHOUT_ Bootless Star, thus - it is possible to run the program immediately by simply double clicking the shell script.
